Previously we used `DummyClassifier` or `DummyRegressor` as a baseline. This time, we'll do something else as a baseline: we'll assume the price stays the same from this week to next week. So, we'll set our prediction of \"AveragePriceNextWeek\" exactly equal to \"AveragePrice\", assuming no change. That is kind of like saying, \"If it's raining today then I'm guessing it will be raining tomorrow\". This simplistic approach will not get a great score but it's a good starting point for reference.

    "I experimented with several approaches of encoding the date. First I extracted standard features such as month, week, and dayofweek, however I wasn't getting strong test scores with my linear ridge model (~0.7) at first. To fix this, I then applied cyclical encoding using sine and cosine transformations to capture the periodic nature of these features. This allowed the model to understand that, for example, December 12th is close to January 1st, which standard integer encoding would not capture. \n",

When fitting the final model, the train r2 was 0.845 and the test r2 was 0.807, which suggests strong generalizeability.\n",

Patients don't always show up on a regular, equally intervaled time schedule for things like lab test results, and it is possible that a patient might miss an appointment. And so we would expect to see a dataset encoding the appointments for patients to have irregular time points as well as some missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lag features would have a more difficult time with unequally spaced time points, as they assume a consistent interval between observations, and when the spacing is irregular, a lag of one time step no longer represents a consistent temporal difference, which can lead to distortion of the modeled relationship. Contrarily, the date as features approach remains somewhat feasible since each observastion carries its own timestamp, independent of the spacing between time points.\n",
